### Morning

I do a plan of what should I do as I get up.I think there's raise about several things, about first thing is is get on your clothes and next thing is to wash your face and brush your teeth, and then eating your breakfast and for one is where are your shoes? There is all those this is so simple habits you have to follow, cause we have to separate our the behavior about get up from the bed with playing with phone. So I think it is important for us to manage our behaviors and treat, treat, treat, treat it as a habit cause I think people always the things randomly, we have to learn how to control it and here are some principles about how can we control our habits. Just make the stops that is all for us to see, so we can see the marks that we placed before so we can do it on our plan and that's easy. So we have to have a plan and figure out how cool could we go into a but situation with full of energy, the period of starting up is vital for us to a day and then they are my strategies that's vital. And also it seemed to the stuffs we have done before we get bad. That's how I think about the tiny behaviors or the marks which place to be to affect our behaviors in the future at at some moment, that's my strategy

And another behavior that I would try as to get up and then before we go to work the have the lots of works we have to walk, walk, walk in our campaign. Just walk, walk around to see different kinds of things, different kinds of treescars and people and the sky, the light and sunlight of the sun. I just walk around and see your environment, your surrounding stuffs because it's diversity. We're activate your mind, activate your body instead of just looking at your homework, the books, a desks, that's it. It's hard to activate yourself. I think there is some stipulation that were inform your body to awake from the sleep, not something to do before we get into the bar, the works, work situation, work state my trial

### Morning

I think this morning we have done three tasks. The first one is to revise your your errors and then to look through the answers and the questions to understand where To familiar with those method you're not understand

### Noon

Lunch time at 11:00 pm,sparked an idea about `Picgo` plugin of `Obsidian` that we can manage _all images_ while being pasted to automatically upload to github repository which as `picgo` server.

And finished the intricate configuration of `Obsidian Linter` which can help us
 format notes perfectly,and it actually intimidated me for reading it's instructions.

finally attachment paths are valid for `makedocs` to recognize,it's weird.

### Afternoon

Firstly I went to the playground for training spreading a fifty minutes, two hundred meter and one hundred and fifty meter. Then we find our state a and now we have the warm up for most ten minutes just for activate your muscles, your your hips and your legs. And you find your ability of symmetry of movement is perfectly good cause I think it because you worked for for warming up your mind and your body this morning. So you before you have the basics exercise, you have the lowest exercise between before the main exercise and as you went to the gym you just do Two groups, for every moments are all actions to activate your muscles from your your arms to your legs and your bully. After that you have the dumplings but actually you find as you a bit of fatigue. So in the period of low lower energy you just wanna play with something, Just figure out your ideas about how to manage your notes more convenient or feasible. After that you realize that you realize you have to stop it for memorize today's words and you finished the memorizing words before nine no, not nine, seven p m and then revise your operating system, homework regards to management allocation, memory allocation of main memory, and then you have to go to bed

I think the rest days my den den habits is not good cause I sleep late because of just wanna surf the internet about Trump's pose or just do notSatisfy with the current day works just I think it's because of your greedy, it interrupt your normal lifestyle,And also I think what kind of people can be an adult? I think it's maybe hard for yours. Also the contemporary young people, the maybe hard to grown up cause the lots of campus or some bad things, but it's bad for the grow up. And I think today, today morning I just writing some essays with the newest charge GBT, I think it's good, but it' took almost the whole morning to complete the related works part and the the norm. I didn't remember what did, but I think I got to the library almost one a m so it almost four hours To complete two tasks of mathematics, one of them is calculus and the other is linear algebra and you find you are extremely fatigue. WHYfiguring out the problems of linear algebra, and you go to dinner about aboutabout five and you let have a nap for almost one hour during the nap I try to learn something about git
