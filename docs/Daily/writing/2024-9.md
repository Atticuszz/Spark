### morning 
I do a plan of what should I do as I get up.I think there's raise about several things, about first thing is is get on your clothes and next thing is to wash your face and brush your teeth, and then eating your breakfast and for one is where are your shoes? There is all those this is so simple habits you have to follow, cause we have to separate our the behavior about get up from the bed with playing with phone. So I think it is important for us to manage our behaviors and treat, treat, treat, treat it as a habit cause I think people always the things randomly, we have to learn how to control it and here are some principles about how can we control our habits. Just make the stops that is all for us to see, so we can see the marks that we placed before so we can do it on our plan and that's easy. So we have to have a plan and figure out how cool could we go into a but situation with full of energy, the period of starting up is vital for us to a day and then they are my strategies that's vital. And also it seemed to the stuffs we have done before we get bad. That's how I think about the tiny behaviors or the marks which place to be to affect our behaviors in the future at at some moment, that's my strategy



And another behavior that I would try as to get up and then before we go to work the have the lots of works we have to walk, walk, walk in our campaign. Just walk, walk around to see different kinds of things, different kinds of treescars and people and the sky, the light and sunlight of the sun. I just walk around and see your environment, your surrounding stuffs because it's diversity. We're activate your mind, activate your body instead of just looking at your homework, the books, a desks, that's it. It's hard to activate yourself. I think there is some stipulation that were inform your body to awake from the sleep, not something to do before we get into the bar, the works, work situation, work state my trial
