## Procedure

### Pre-Screening

All papers must be written in English and are pre-screened to ensure that only the most significant are sent for review. Please ensure that your manuscript satisfies the following points:

1. Originality: is the work scientifically rigorous, accurate and novel? Does the work contain significant additional material to that already published? Has its value been demonstrated?
2. Motivation: does the problem considered have a sound motivation? Does the paper clearly demonstrate the scientific interest of the results?
3. Referencing: has reference been made to the most recent and most appropriate work? Is the present work set in the context of the previous work?
4. Clarity: is the English clear and well written? Poorly written English may obscure the scientific merit of your paper. Are the ideas expressed clearly and concisely? Are the concepts understandable?
